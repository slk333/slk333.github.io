So you can talk to the computer. But it's more than that. It's more like to use the computer as an extension of your brain, just like we use the machines to extend our body limited capabilities. So what does a computer have to offer that we don't have already ?

Relatively to our brain, a computer has:

*   infinite memory
*   infinite processing power
*   better communication skills in certain areas

Furthermore, a computer can:

*   communicate with humans, in a readable and expressive way (2D screens)
*   communicate with other computers, instantaneously (internet)

The software takes advantage of the computer capabilities to handle data:

*   store data, any amount, any duration, and reliably
*   modify data (add, update, delete)
*   retrieve specific data
*   process data
*   represent and present data in a useful way

Exciting, right ? Well it's exciting because there is a big potential to explore and to master.
