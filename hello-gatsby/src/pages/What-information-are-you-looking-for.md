## Where is the information?

Information is everywhere. Useful information is more rare. Useful information is often gated by many or different layers. Useful information is often not free. Useful information is also often not publicly available, and some of it is unobtainable from the average people. Some information is only available through certain people, and you need to know them personally, which in most cases is not possible or not practical. Internet gave us the possibility to contact a lot of people directly through Twitter. It's a useful tool in that regard. 

## The value of information

Google and websites provide information. News website will provide information, aka news, but that information won't always be neutral and won't always be comprehensive. The information might be distorted, exaggerated, sensationalised etc.. Or the information might come way too late.
â€¨

Information is money. If you have the information, you can create things that other cannot. You can gain decisive advantage. Information is not free. Gathering information is work. You pay it either by getting exposed to ads, and/or by paying with some of your privacy information. You can also pay it with money, or by exchanging some of your own information in return.

## How to use the information?

You can either store the information in your brain or keep it in your notes so that you can have access to it without the "hassle" of remembering them. Notes are also great for information that the brain is not good at remembering, for exemple long arbitrary data that doesn't make sense by itself.
