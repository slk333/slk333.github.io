`Hello World!`

Why I'm making a custom blog instead of using ready-to-use solutions like Blogger, Medium or Wordpress:

*   Blogger is really easy to use. But it's not original, and you cannot customize it much. Actually, you can barely customize it. And i'm not even sure it's still maintained.
*   Medium is definitely an option to consider. And I might decide to use Medium in the future. But again, it's not original, and it does not feel like my own.
*   Lastly, Wordpress is something I've never used yet. I might give it a shot very soon. I think it's fully customisable. So there is no excuse here. Plus, it is said to offer many things as a bonus.

So in the end, what did I choose ? I chose to do everything without third parties, except for the hosting, obviously:

*   Hosting is free and is Github Pages, aka github.io pages. Main advantage is that whenever I commit a change on my git repo, the website is directly updated.
*   Html and Css is fully made from scratch. Except from a very minimal html template, i wrote everything myself trying to keep it as small as possible, in a minimalist approach.
*   Taking the website nshipster.com as a model, I try to find what is necessary, in the content structure and in the styling.

This is it for the first article on this website. See you around, folks!
