The problem: It's cumbersome to write html by hand. When you write a blog post, you want to focus on what you write, and not on what html tag you will use here and what css class you will use there.

On the other hand, you will still need to format your text in the end. You cannot just put a raw text in your html and call it a day. It will look ugly.

Putting html tags on your text afterwards is as much annoying as doing it beforehands. So what's the solution there ?

The solution is to give up completely on writing the html code by hand everytime you want to write a post. On the contrary, you will use a processing script that will create the hmtl tags by itself.

But how can a script know what and how to format things ? That's where Markdown formatting Language comes to the rescue. Markdown will use the punctuation you naturally use to get the formatting just right.

For exemple, Markdown will transform the following list:

    - Apples
    - Bananas
    - Strawberry

into a proper html code made of ul and li that will render like this :

*   Apples
*   Bananas
*   Strawberry

And that's it for today, we will see more of Markdown in a next article. See you folks!
