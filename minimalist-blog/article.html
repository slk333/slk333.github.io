            Emoji is a conspiracy by the Unicode® Consortium to make Americans care about internationalization.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a time, many developers operated under the assumption that user-input would be primarily
            Latin-1-compatible. Or at least they could feel reasonably assured that everything would fall within the
            Basic Multilingual Plane — fitting comfortably into a single UTF-16 code unit.
        </p>
        <p>
            But nowadays, with Emoji emerging as the lingua franca of these troubled times, text is presumed
            international until proven otherwise. Everyone should be ready for when the U+1F4A9 hits the fan.
        </p>
        <p>
            So whatever you think about those colorful harbingers of societal collapse, at least they managed to break
            us of our ASCII-only information diets.

            This week on NSHipster, we’ll be looking at a relatively obscure part of macOS that will prove essential
            for developers in today’s linguistic landscape: Character Viewer
