		<p><code>Hello World!</code></p>
		<p>
			Why I'm making a custom blog instead of using ready-to-use solutions like Blogger, Medium or
			Wordpress:
		</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Blogger is really easy to use. But it's not original, and you cannot customize
					it much. Actually, you can barely customize it. And i'm not even sure it's
					still maintained.

				</li>
				<li>
					Medium is definitely an option to consider. And I might decide to use Medium in
					the future. But again, it's not original, and it does not feel like my own.

				</li>
				<li>
					Lastly, Wordpress is something I've never used yet. I might give it a shot very
					soon. I think it's fully customisable. So there is no excuse here. Plus, it is
					said to offer many things as a bonus.

				</li>

			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			So in the end, what did I choose ? I chose to do everything without third parties, except for
			the hosting, obviously:

		</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Hosting is free and is Github Pages, aka github.io pages. Main advantage is
					that whenever I commit a change on my git repo, the website is directly
					updated.

				</li>
				<li>
					Html and Css is fully made from scratch. Except from a very minimal html
					template, i wrote everything myself trying to keep it as small as possible, in
					a minimalist approach.
				</li>
				<li>
					Taking the website nshipster.com as a model, I try to find what is necessary,
					in the content structure and in the styling.

				</li>

			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			This is it for the first article on this website. See you around, folks!
