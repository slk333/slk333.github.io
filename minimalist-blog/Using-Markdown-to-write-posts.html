<p>The problem: It's cumbersome to write html by hand. When you write a blog post, you want to focus on what you write, and not on what html tag you will use here and what css class you will use there.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you will still need to format your text in the end. You cannot  just put a raw text in your html and call it a day. It will look ugly.</p>

<p>Putting html tags on your text afterwards is as much annoying as doing it beforehands. So what's the solution there ?</p>

<p>The solution is to give up completely on writing the html code by hand everytime you want to write a post. On the contrary, you will use a processing script that will create the hmtl tags by itself.</p>

<p>But how can a script know what and how to format things ? That's where Markdown formatting Language comes to the rescue. Markdown will use the punctuation you naturally use to get the formatting just right.</p>

<p>For exemple, Markdown will transform the following list:</p>

<pre><code>- Apples
- Bananas
- Strawberry
</code></pre>

<p>into a proper html code made of ul and li that will render like this :</p>

<ul>
<li>Apples</li>

<li>Bananas</li>

<li>Strawberry</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's it for today, we will see more of Markdown in a next article. See you folks!</p>
